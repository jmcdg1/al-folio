I am a member of the Software Engineering Research Group of the Faculty of Computer Science at the University of Murcia (Spain), led by Dr. Ambrosio Toval. I currently work there as an Associate Professor at the Department of Informatics and Systems.

I hold a PhD in Software Engineering, a five-year BSc in Computer Science and an one-year MSc in Industrial Informatics from the University of Murcia. I also have a three-year BSc in Nursing from the same university.

My main research interests currently lie in the areas of requirements engineering, requirements reuse, global software engineering, requirements management tools and empirical software engineering. I have also been involved in other research lines, such as e-learning, e-health, e-archaeology, computer-based nursing learning and medical image processing.

I am co-author of many scientific papers published both in national and international conferences and journals. I have participated in technology transfer research contracts and regional, national and international research projects.

I was awarded scholarships from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) and the Mediterranean Office for Youth (MOY) that made it possible for me to carry out research stays at the University of Stuttgart (Stuttgart, Germany) and the Mohammed V University (Rabat, Morocco).

I have also completed numerous training courses on various topics such as agile project management, continuous process improvement, management of software development outsourcing, etc.

I am married and I have three sons. My beautiful family occupies most of my spare time, but apart from this, some of my main hobbies and interests are reading books and newspapers, watching sports, playing video games, walking, listening to music and photography.

[comment]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[comment]: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[comment]: Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
